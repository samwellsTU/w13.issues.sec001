The **Issues** tab is where you can track tasks, bugs, feature requests, questions, or any other actionable item related to the project.

### How to Use It

⠀**2. Create a New Issue**
* Click the green **"New issue"** button.
* Add a **title** that clearly describes the problem or idea.
* Use the **description** box to:
    * Explain the context.
    * List steps to reproduce (for bugs).
    * Add screenshots, code snippets, or references if helpful.
* (Optional) Use **Markdown** for formatting (e.g., **bold**, - lists, # headings).

⠀**3. Apply Labels (if you have permission)**
* Labels help organize issues (e.g., bug, enhancement, question).
* Maintainers can create and assign labels for better tracking.

⠀**4. Assign People or Projects (if needed)**
